Rewards may be hundreds of steps in the future, and any of the policy choices between now and then might be crucial, yet we bootstrap values far back into the past.</p><p>Looking at it from a tabular RL perspective, it is surprising that Atari works at all. Best action for a random policy is often the best action for the optimal policy?</p><p>Extrapolation is going to be wrong more often than interpolation. Unclamped relu can be dangerous.</p><p>Dropout should be useful, but hasn’t been yet. Same with weight decay and decay to initialization.</p><h1 id="value-representation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#value-representation"><span>Value representation</span></a></h1><p>Even for a policy gradient algorithm, you still have a state value. It seems unlikely that brains are representing scalar values over many orders of magnitude. One of my pet ideas is to use polar values with rotary wrap-around, since all you care about is which action is best, and all actions will usually be close in range.</p><h2 id="classic-dqn-clamping" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#classic-dqn-clamping"><span>Classic DQN clamping</span></a></h2><p>Clamping rewards at -1/1 for stability and to allow the same learning rate to work well for all games.</p><p>Ms Pac-Man single dot is 10 points, while bonus items can be thousands of points.</p><h2 id="categorical-representations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#categorical-representations"><span>Categorical representations</span></a></h2><p>Categorical representation, values vs full distributional</p><p>Stop regressing stated that a simple categorical value with a gaussian spread worked better than a full categorical operator, which seems surprising.</p><p>Probably still not the best because it ignores the ordinal nature, something like earthmover loss might be better</p><h2 id="muzero-quadratic-value-compression" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#muzero-quadratic-value-compression"><span>MuZero quadratic value compression</span></a></h2><p>Doesn’t interpolate linearly, and still has a range hyperparameter.</p><h2 id="mse-was-all-we-needed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mse-was-all-we-needed"><span>MSE was all we needed?</span></a></h2><p>Somewhat surprisingly, not clamping rewards works fine with MSE loss, even when the losses are in the millions on some games – nothing explodes, even without gradient clamping or Huber loss, but learning is slower.</p><p>Scaling experiments</p><p>Adam/RMSProp normalization, SGD for the final layer, weight norm on earlier layers.</p><p>There may be challenges with multi-task across games with huge point differences – Pong with Video Pinball.</p><h1 id="conv-nets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conv-nets"><span>Conv Nets</span></a></h1><p>Still seems to be the architecture of choice for image digestion.</p><h2 id="big-image-nets-don-t-work-well-for-rl" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#big-image-nets-don-t-work-well-for-rl"><span>Big image nets don’t work well for RL</span></a></h2><p>Twice I have replaced my simple strided CNN with some of the large scale categorization models from the pytorch library like ConvNeXT, and despite being a bigger model that is state of the art for many classification and backbone tasks, seen it perform worse for my QV RL tasks. Classification performance for a model does not directly correlate to online RL performance. Figuring out exactly how the needs diverge may be worthwhile at some point.</p><h2 id="kernel-subsets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kernel-subsets"><span>Kernel subsets</span></a></h2><p>Can we learn better function architectures? CNN kernel subset failure example: A 5x5 kernel is a strict superset of a 3x3 kernel, yet it often learns worse, even with more parameters. Weight decay should reduce the impact of noise features, but it can take a very long time.</p><h2 id="parameter-sharing-increases-performance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parameter-sharing-increases-performance"><span>Parameter sharing increases performance</span></a></h2><p>CNN shared weights are biologically implausible, but sort of like moving a focus point around.</p><p>Testing with unshared CNN parameters was worse, at least in the few-million-steps regime. At the limit, unshared should be better, and you could transition.</p><h2 id="factored-1d-cnns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#factored-1d-cnns"><span>Factored 1D CNNs</span></a></h2><p>Factoring CNN to 2x1D should help more, and did in CIFAR-10, but not for RL.</p><h2 id="isotropic-cnns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#isotropic-cnns"><span>Isotropic CNNs</span></a></h2><p>CNN’s aren’t fully position independent as soon as you have a pooling layer or strided conv.
